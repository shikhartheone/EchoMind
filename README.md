# EchoMind

EchoMind is a real-time AI meeting assistant that joins live meetings, listens to conversations, and provides live summaries, action items, and contextual Q&A.

It is built as part of the Lenskart A1.3 assignment.

## Tech Stack

- LiveKit (WebRTC for meetings)
- React (Frontend)
- Node.js (Backend)
- Whisper (Speech-to-Text)
- LLM (Gemini / OpenAI)
- Vector Database (RAG)

## High-Level Idea

Users join a meeting in the EchoMind web app.  
An AI agent joins the same meeting, listens to participants, understands the discussion, and provides live intelligence during the call.
